# Data Preprocessing

This directory contains a script to make a prediction

## Preconditions
Data needs to be ready and a model needs to be trained. See the `train_model/` directory.


## Explanation
`do_prediction` can make a prediction based on a youtube video ID with a model that has been trained. Please input the name of the model you want to use in the script (should be in the `data/` directory). Also input the youtube video ID and the genre it falls under in the script. After that you can run it!
